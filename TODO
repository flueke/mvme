TODO list somewhat sorted by priority
==================================================

* Fix mesytec diagnostics not working properly with sis3153. Is that even a controller problem?

* add sis3153 firmware update utility to 'extras' directory. Also package and install sis library code (maybe).

--------------------------------------------------
Rate displays and Rate monitoring
--------------------------------------------------
* analaysis combined rate calculation thingy:
    calibrate,
    calc difference between cur and prev
    make rate output available
  How to build these things easily?
  a2 level: combine existing operators
  a1 level: input/output logic
            create a2 instance and query for output sizes

* Make mvme internal "system" rates available to the analysis.
  Might split this into VME and Analysis rates. Think about how to feed those
  to the analysis system.
  Make this efficient and easily integrated.
  XXX: Do not make these rates available inside the analysis in the first step.
  Figure out how to manage counters and rates first!

  A summary screen similar to what wanpengs screenshot shows:
  I'd like a catalog of all available rates in the system.
  The user should be able to easily add/remove rates to monitor in a sort of
  table view.
  Certain rates should also be plotted in combined rate display.

  How to handle different time bases then? This would mean differing X-axis
  scales so is not a good idea.

  See next item.

  every hit.
  Structure changes as analysis
  filters are modified.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Additional info for each counter:
  [scaling factor and offset] (basically calibration information)
  unit label
  unitscaling: binary / decimal
  poll interval / timebase, e.g: 1/s 1/timeticks


* Notes about timetick based updates:
  The update could be done on every timetick that's either contained in the
  listfile or that's generated by the MVMEStreamWorker during readout.

  Another way would be to perform the update at an interval that's not related
  to the timeticks, calculate the timetick difference and the rate average over
  that period and then push the calculated average multiple times onto the
  history buffer, once for each elapsed timetick.
  This would cause less load but make the rate history less exact in the case
  where the replay is faster than realtime.

RateHistory needs to only be kept if the specific rate should be plotted.
Otherwise if the rate should only be displayed it's enough to keep the last
(most recent) rate value that was calculated. The GUI should be able to pick
that up.

Totals are also interesting and should be displayed alongside rates.

System design:
List / Tree of available counters. Must be able to deal with arrays of known
size, like ModuleCounters[E][M]. On the other hand at runtime it is known how
many events and modules there are so only parts of the arrays have to be
exposed.

Hierarchy is good. Names are good. Serialization of the information to restore
a counter display and the required history buffers is needed.
Then be able to find a RateHistoryBuffer via a "hierarchy path".


readout.bytes
readout.buffers
streamProc.bytes
streamProc.event[0] .. event[N] with N either begin MaxVMEEvents or the actual number of events in the VMEConfig
streamProc.event[0].module[0] with limits being the number of events and the number of modules in that event

accessor function to get the current counter value
accessor function to get the previous counter value
-> delta calc possible
accessor to get calibration variables and unit labels and additional options
accessor to get the RateHistoryBuffer for the specific counter
-> filling the buffer is possible

With a system like this different counters could be updated in different
places, e.g. some counters could be handled entirely in the GUI, others might
be updated iff it's a replay and a timetick section is processed.

The update code needs an efficient way to query the rate monitoring system for
counters it needs to process:

void foo(double sample_value)
{
    // constant during the course of the run
    auto byteRateHandle = get_handle_for("daqtime.streamProc.bytes");

    enter_sample(byteRateHandle, sample_value);
}

// FIXME: where does dt come from? does each "sampler" have to pass its own dt?
void enter_sample(RateHandle handle, double value, double dt_s)
{
    prev = value(handle);
    delta = calc_delta0(value, prev);
    setValue(handle, value);
    setDelta(handle, delta);
    rate = delta / dt;
    rate = calibrate_rate(handle, rate)
    if (auto historyBuffer = get_rate_history_buffer(handle))
    {
        historyBuffer->push_back(rate);
    }
}

void handle_replay_timetick() // somewhere in the MVMEStreamProcessor
{

    for (int ei = 0; ei < MaxVMEEvents; ei++)
    {
        for (int mi = 0; mi < MaxVMEModules; mi++)
        {
            enter_sample()
        }
    }

    if (rate_monitor_enabled_for(handle))
        rate_monitor_sample(
}

--------------------------------------------------
Single Stepping and Stream Processing
--------------------------------------------------
* Show if multievent processing is active for an event
* Display buffer context in case of a parse error

* Distinction/difference between a stream and a buffer?
  As a buffer can contain multiple section or even a complete listfile it is an MVMEStream.
  But an MVMEStream will mostly consist of multiple buffers as generated by the readout or from reading a listfile.

* Info to parse an mvme stream and report errors:
  - is multievent enabled for eventIndex N?
  - module header filter strings for (eventIndex, moduleIndex)
  - listfile format version

* State:
  BufferIterator
  EventIterator

* Result information for each step:
  - error?
  - error offset
  - data offsets: event section header, module section header, module data begin, module data end
    [number of this event section], [number of the module sections in the event section]
  Available info from the above: section type, event index

* Approaches to handling a stream:
  - Iterator style
    Create an StreamBufferIterator supplying all required information to parse
    the buffer.
    Call next() on the buffer until the result is atEnd.

  - Callback based
    The user passes in a structure containing callbacks for each section type
    and for module data. Not all callbacks have to be implented as they can be
    set to null.
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
CombiningFilter and CombiningExtractor
--------------------------------------------------
* 64 bit DataFilter
* phase out data_filter.h (DataFilter and MultiWordDataFilter)

* Ordering of CombiningExtractors:
  A list of CombiningExtractor is attached to a module. The order of those
  extractors is important and must be kept the same when transforming to a2 and
  when loading from config as these extractors must be executed in order.

* Redo the way EventWidget and AddEditExtractorWidget work together right now.
  Move the add/edit code from EventWidget::addSource()/sourceEdited() into the
  dialog. Let the dialog notify the EventWidget about changes via a signal.


--------------------------------------------------
* Auto save and restore analysis session

* Remove now unused run-time code from the Analysis classes. Make it clear that
  they're for serialization, internal connectiviy and a2 generation only.
* analysis session: errors out when saving and empty analysis session
  - enable the save action only if the analysis is non-empty
  - change the session code to be able to handle empty analyses

* cmake: Fix the issue with FindROOT adding to the global cflags. Might be
  fixed by moving everything ROOT related into a subdirectory.

* Get rid of automoc and as it mocs stuff that doesn't need mocing.

* Fix sphinx doc build when using the cmake ninja generator.

* Setup controller outputs (NIM, etc) to be active when DAQ is active and maybe
  more. Do this for both controllers and document and/or log what's being setup.

* Crash in a2_adapter when BinSumDiff inputs don't have the same length

* Display actual size of the listfile on the disk. Avoids having to pull
  information from the quazip/zlib libs. Display the size after the listfile
  has been loaded, not after the replay has started

* sis3153 implementation
  * On connect read the stacklist control register to figure out if the sis is
    in autonomous mode. If it is and a controller option "Reset SIS3153 on
    connect" is not set then consider the connection attempt to have failed.
    Reasoning: currently when accidentially connecting to a sis that's in use,
    a reset command will be sent and thus the running DAQ will be stopped. This
    can be quite bad if it happens during a real experiment.

  * Running "Init Module" when disconnected blocks the UI
  * Make the mblt count read commands work with the default data_len_format
    setting. Use the leftshift value of the sis register for this.
    Document the behaviour, maybe change the command to not include the mask
    anymore, etc...
  * Think about the sis3153 counted block read commands. Maybe add a "dialect" to
    vmescript so that the fact that sis3153 does not have a mask operation is
    clear.
  * Fix sis lost packet count. On robert's windows machine it's still bugged and
    jumps to 1.6e7 or so instantly!

virtual void SIS3153ReadoutWorker::stop()

  * Fix socket error messages under windows. Use and test the WSA stuff.


* check the case where listfile creation throws an exception. right now this
  results in a communication error with the sis controller when trying to start
  another run after a failed one.

* Fix crash in analysis ui when moving an operator. Happens with the PMT test
  setup when moving one of the rightmost 2d histos.
  -> Cannot reproduce anymore...

* Checks what's up with the size limit of the log view. It never seems to stop
  growing and that's part of why there's such a major slowdown when being
  spammed by controller errors.
  The goal is to only keep a certain number of messages around and never grow
  above a certain amount of memory. A circular buffer might be good...

* Fix anaylsis object selection color under win7. It's horrible and the text is
  not readable anymore.

* Improve VMEScriptEditor search:
  Make it get focus under windows and unity
  Make it get focus when hitting ctrl+f again
  Bind "find next" to F3 or something.
  Maybe add "highlight" all.

* Analysis: fix names generated by "generate default filters"

* Analysis: getDisplayName() and getShortName() are not that great. For the
  AggregateOps operator I'd like to display "Aggregate Operations" in the "add
  operator" context menu instead of "sum". Where else is getDisplayName() used?
  -> The above works. What I need now is to change the suggested operator name
  of selecting a different aggregate op. Right now it always appends ".sum".

* Add a scaler display somewhere. What does this show? Hz?

* Resolution change for 2D combined histograms?
  -> Would have to implement this in a different way: Instead of just looking
  up the data in the corresponding H1D instances I'd have to create a new H2D
  with the desired resolution and insert the source values into that histogram.

* Make a RCbus example including a delay between switchting NIM to cbus mode!

* Implement adding of module specific vme init scripts via the GUI.
  The user should be able to modify the order of init scripts by
  dragging/dropping, remove existing scripts and add new ones.
  Optionally copying of an init script to the same or a different module could
  be implemented.

* Maybe reload the analysis on opening a listfile.
  Without the reload the analysis window can become empty if the listfile
  contains different module uuids than the ones in the analysis. A reload could
  trigger a simple 1->1 import of the module and all would be good again.
  The reload could als trigger opening the import dialog if it requires user
  intervention.

* Logspam still makes the app hang! Fix this!!!

* Histo1D and Histo1DWidget
    * Bug: H1D does not work when unitMin > unitMax
    * Histo1DWidget: zoom out after setHistogram()
      But not when the usage is the one in x- and y-projections where the histo is
      replaced with a similar one.
    * Histo1DWidget: The curve for the last bin is not drawn. Try to finally find a fix for this.
    * Read up on binning error calculations. See how ROOT does it.
    * show fwhm only when gauss display is active

* Analysis and AnalysisUI
    * Open new histograms immediately. Do this when creating a sub-histogram.
      Maybe only if DAQ/Replay is running?
    * Copy/Paste
      - Copy needs a clone() operation for analysis elements.
      - On copying an extractor the edit dialog should be opened.
      - Having the ability to clone operators would allow making editing of
        operators much safer.
        Right now if the user picks another input or clears any input slots the
        analysis has to be paused and restarted and dependent operators
        immediately notice the change. This means even if the user cancels the
        dialog the analysis can have unexpected modifications.
        With cloning a copy of the operator would be created. Selecting and
        clearing inputs would only affect the cloned version of the operator
        (input pipes would not need to be fully connected so the input sources
        do not need to change at all during editing -> half connected state!)

- Add error reporting to VMEConfig and Analysis version conversion and read routines

- Refactor gui_write_json_file() to write_json_file() and use exceptions to report errors.
  Meaning: implement functionality using exceptions and not caring about if
  it's used from the gui or not. Then build and use gui wrappers which show
  messageboxes where needed.

- Add warnings to template loading if there are duplicate module types
- Fix diagnosis window hanging and eating system memory when EOE check is
  active and a lot of errors are occuring

* Log throttling!!!!

* Check for off-by-one errors in the 2D projection code

* lastlog.log:
  Write every logged message to lastlog.log. Do this in the main thread. Flush
  to disk frequently.
  At startup move lastlog.log to lastlog.1.log.
  Keep 5 logfiles around. 4 -> 5, 3 -> 4, 2 -> 3, 1 -> 2, 0 -> 1



* select input UI: disable other tree highlights while it's active.
* ZIP file support:
  On close:
  - write some user description text file to the zip. "Run description", "Run notes", "DAQ notes"
 - save/saveas/load error reporting

* VMEConfig
    * Allow Adding of VME-Init scripts to modules via the gui!

* EventWidget and AnalysisWidget repopulate:
  - Restore open PipeDisplays:
    Store (ObjectId, OutputIndex) to get the output pipe and (pos, size) to restore the widget.
  - Restore splitter states when recreating event widgets.
  - Restore node expansion state
    Could store QUuids for expanded object nodes and after repop rebuild the
    VoidStar set of expanded nodes by getting the pointers via the ids.
* Analysis structure:
  SourceEntry does not really need the eventId as the moduleId implicitly
  specifies the eventId.
* H1D: Take the median of the visible left and right edges. Subtract that value
  from the calculated statistics values. This is supposed to remove the noise
  to the left and right of a peak.
* HistoViewer: Ability to save filled Histograms to disk and reload them later.
  This will allow using histogram tools (fits, etc.) on loaded histos. It also
  allows comparing histos from different runs etc.
* Calculated listfile size in stats display and size shown by windows explorer
  are not the same at all. Why?
* // FIXME: when using subranges the getBinUnchecked() calculation often yields negative bins. why?
  Verify this does in fact happen.
* DAQStats:
  - add pause/resume
  - figure out why buffers/s never has a fractional part
    -> part of the system. addBuffersRead() and addBytesRead() each call maybeUpdateIntervalCounters().
       If we're reading less than 1 buffer per second the resulting bytesPerSecond will be 0 for that interval.
    How to make this better?
- License info needs Apache License for PCG. Maybe others. Check what is needed here!
  Also use info from resources/README
- VMUSB: if there are connect/reconnect errors write them to the log view
  Do this when porting to libusb-1.0 as that should also provide better error messages.
- VMUSB: make the mutex non-recursive!

* GUI
  * add versioning to the GUI state saved via QSettings. If the version changes
    use the default layout instead of restoring a possibly incompatible state.
  * add a "reset gui state" button somewhere

* add ability to add notes to VME/analysis config (maybe other objects too)
* VMEScript: add print command
* Limit the number of messages/s appended to the logview. With multithreading:
  do messages fill up one of the threads event queues? Can this be limited
  somehow? Better to directly limit the generation of these messages?

* Histos:
  * add histogram cuts
  * add histogram fitting

* Mesytec Werbung ^^ Hintergrundbilder, Wasserzeichen, etc. (CSS Theme?)
* Hist2d: look for standard color scales as used in publications, ROOT, etc.
  https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/TColor_8cxx_source.html#l02400
* How to handle filters without matching module? Right now they're not
  displayed until a module with the corresponding (eventIndex,moduleIndex) is
  created.
  Related: Remove Hist2d on filter removal?
  => would all be fixed when moving from (eventIndex, moduleIndex) to using object ids.

* threading and vme commands
  * run vme scripts in a separate thread when invoked from the gui

* save and restore the zoom and pan of histograms
* save and restore open histograms
* Fix diagnostics window blocking when there are a lot of error messages being generated.
