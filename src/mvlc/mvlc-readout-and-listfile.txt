Answered Questions
------------------
What's the maximum length of a single event the MVLC can produce?
-> There is no maximum length. Data would come in F9 blocks with the Continue bit set
   until the last F9 where Continue is cleared.
   For practical reasons event size should be limited for an event based analysis.
   Streaming data must be handled differently and is not inside the scope of mvme.
   Limit single event readout size to 1MB (262144 words).

Terminology
-----------
* loss / external loss: Ethernet packet loss caused by network congestion or the receiver
  being too slow.

* internal loss: Caused by the DAQ producing data faster than the analysis can consume.
  Occurs only during a live DAQ run, never during a replay from file.
  The granularity of the what's lost is entirely up to mvme. Large buffers containing many
  events lead to better performance but higher UI latency when pausing/stopping.
  Smaller buffers lead to worse analysis performance but faster reaction times.
  Buffers of roughly 1MB do seem to work ok with the existing controlers and mvme formats.

USB
---------------
No loss, no packets, no framing.
Starting point is the start of the first incoming buffer. Must be F3 (StackBuffer). The
next header after that can be found at (prev_header + prev_size).

To deal with internal loss an offset to the next header is needed. Otherwise the analyis
side does not have a resume point.

=> Add a HeaderOffset value to each of the internal buffers. This means the readout side
has to know and follow the buffer structure so that it is able to calculate and set the
HeaderOffset value.
  => Need one iteration pass over the incoming data.
  => Need at least one additional data word per internal buffer.
  => An open StackBuffer or any open data structure does not have to be terminated within
  the current internal buffer. Processing can continue without that guaranteee as long as
  the buffer header pointer is present and correct.
  But having non-terminated internal buffers can lead to more lost data events than with
  terminated buffers. The start of a new event can be lost which makes the data in the
  following non-lost buffer invalid for processing. The end of an event can be lost which
  in turn means data from the prior buffer has to be discarded once this case is detected.
  It would be better to guarantee that at least all internal structures 0xF3/F9, etc are
  terminated within one such internal buffer.

=> Implement the case where it is guaranteed that internal framing structures are terminated
   within a buffer. This in turn means that no header pointer needs to be present as each
   new buffer will start with a header (F3/F9).


Ethernet / UDP
---------------
Loss is expected. Data arrives in packets of <= 1500 / < 9k bytes. Each packet has two
header words, with one containing an offset to the next StackBuffer/StackContinuation
header (F3 or F9).

External loss is detected via PacketNumbers. Bursts of up to 4095 lost packets can be
detected.

Internal loss can be mitigated by beginning each internal buffer with a packet. This way a
pointer to the next stack header will be present at the start of the buffer.
The guarantee would be that packets are never split across internal buffers.
