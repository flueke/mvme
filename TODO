==================================================
TODO list
==================================================

* analysis: Directories contain references to ids of deleted objects. Could be
  cleaned up when saving the analysis or right at the time where the objects
  are deleted. Should be very simialar to the code that moves objects out of a
  directory.

* vme script execution:
  - immediately produce log output for each command
  - abort early in case of errors

* Maybe: remove the VME controller auto (re)connect feature. instead try to connect when needed.

* Load module templates from JSON, then converte existing module templates to
  JSON format. Also add the updated TRIVA template (it's in an email from R.)

* Packet loss and error counters for the MVLC command side.

* Document ListFilterExtractor

* Update the EventServer and Clients to handle multi-output data sources (MultiHit Extractor).

* VME Script execution in the timeout/error case can hang for a long while.
  Instead the execution should be aborted earlier, upong encountering the first
  error.

* DAQ init sequence: on error try to link back or highlight the VME script that
  caused the error.

* Configurable colors for the Trigger/IO connection arrows (Nik).

* FIXME: crateIndex handling is unclear. Should it be specified in
  make_readout_parser()? This works for the current readout code as it's
  purely handled on the software side and doesn't care about the CtrlId
  set for the MVLC.
  On the other hand the listfile_generation code and the merged multicrate
  listfiles do need the crateIndex present in the data stream. It's already
  used in mvlc_stream_worker.cc to check for UnixTimetick events coming from
  the main crate. Also the same code ignores the crateIndex completely! Weird
  state right now!


* when stopping a run do wait for the analysis to finish. right now the code
  only waits for the readout/replay side to finish.

* add an assert macro to get rid of the unused var warnings when compiling in
  release mode
    #ifdef NDEBUG
    #define ASSERT(x) do { (void)sizeof(x);} while (0)
    #else
    #include <assert.h>
    #define ASSERT(x) assert(x)
    #endif

* Add undo/redo buttons to the vme_script editor.

* Errors from the mvlc analysis callback chain could be reported in a better way:
 [2021-10-19 15:04:38.684] [readout_parser] [warning] end parsing ETH buffer 1, size=1048320 bytes, exception=vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 0) >= this->size() (which is 0)
 [2021-10-19 15:04:38.689] [readout_parser] [warning] exception from parse_eth_packet(): vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 0) >= this->size() (which is 0), skipping packet

 => No idea where the occured. Horrible to debug. std::function does not make it easier.


* EventBuilder integration into analysis?
  event0
    mdpp32_qdc \
    mdpp16_qdc  |-> User defined data sources attached to the real modules.
    vmmr       /

  In addition to the reversion issue of the VME settings, I'd like to comment more on the MVME software (v1.4.6), in particular for some desired online features:

  * Rate monitor is very useful. But right now it either displays the full range or can be zoomed in for a fixed range. It'll be more useful if one can make it visible for the last hour or some designated period of time while keep incrementing.

  * Right now, 1-d histograms can only be displayed one by one. Is it possible to overlap two or three plots in the same window for comparison? That would be a great feature to have.

  * A dynamic count rate ratio would be good for online monitoring. Right now, I am using three steps to construct it (prev, diff, and division). It'd be great if you can implement one operation like (rate1 - rate1_previous_value) / (rate2 - rate2_previous_value) for a simple definition.

  * a standalone config editor.


* analysis operator event affinity:
  See file 1_mdpp16.analysis:
  - amplitudes are extracted but the histo is never filled.
  - editing the histo shows that the event context is set to 'unspecified'
  - changing it to the correct event immediately fixes the problem.
  How to fix? Auto assign to the parent module? Also before being able to
  explicitly specify the event affinity there must have been some way this was
  stored or determined.

* wrong state after creating a new workspace:
  - in the old workspace open a listfile
  - select File -> New Workspace
  - create a directory and accept via 'Ok'
  => The start button still shows "Start Replay", the listfile from the old workspace
     is still open.

* Workspace switching under windows: sometimes mvme.log cannot be moved to
  last_mvme.log. mvme still has an open handle to the log file at this point
  (renaming using the explorer also does not work).
* Do not allow (or warn about) relative writes in the Readout Loop -> Cycle Start/End scripts.
* The run script button of the VMEScriptEditor inside the Trigger IO GUI does
  not work. The runScript() signal is not connected to anything.
* Crash when opening workspace directory which does not contain a mvmeworkspace.ini
* Test opening the same workspace directory that's currently open again.
  mvme.log and last_mvme.log seem to cause trouble in that case.

* Rate Monitor:
  - mouse hover sample index is often negative
  - stats display needs updating for Sample based x-scale
  - avg. Rate in the stats display is incorrectly 0 most of the times. why?
  - it's so messy :(

* DSO gui:
  - histogramming: could switch between osciolloscope and histogram view.
    draw rising and falling edge times in different colors.
  - When modifying the trigIO the trace select tree gets collapsed :(
  - Sim: 36ns difference between simulated and sampled routed trace. why? subtract it?

* trigger_io: when changing a vme event from periodic to irq the trigger_io
  timer -> stack_start connection is not disabled. Could find out which timer
  was used to trigger the event and remove the connection from the timer to the
  stackstart unit.
* When a ListfitlerExtractor changes size an open RateMonitorWidget is not
  properly updated. The legend will be updated but the number of elements is
  not updated. Something is not correct here.
* Difference operator asserts when arrays have different sizes and when one
  array has size 1 (different assertion).
* add checks for mesytec modules analysing the eventcounter/timestamp values
  This should happen after multi event processing and should be fast. So just
  picking the last word of each events module data should be enough.
  Handle overflow properly!

* analysis cross-process copy/paste is broken
* make named indices inline renamable (maybe, these are weird anyways)

* doc: Add network tuning and data export section
* document MVLC jumbo frame support in mvme manual
* finally write mesytec-mvlc library docs

* [analysis]
  * Module data Prefix/Suffix is missing from:
    - a2 system
    - analysis ui
    - EventServer

  - Rename (internally these are called extractors):
    * MultiwordFilter -> Word Pattern Filter
    * Listfilter -> Word Order Filter
  - Add new extractor or make the multiword one even more complicated:
    Start filter with optional size bits    <- yields the number of words the extraction filter should be applied to
    Extraction filter                       <- extract (address, value) pairs
    Optional End filter; required if no size bits are given. <- Stop processing once this matches.

  - Conditions: core should be functional, work on the UIs again

  - listfilter add is buggy: the last filter is selected and will be edited if
    not manually pressing the 'add' button

* vme modules: allow saving a concrete module to a vme template.
  Allow instantiating modules from user vme templates.  Important: handle the
  analysis correctly: if module type name stays the same the current code will
  load the correct analysis default filters.

* analysis: allow more than just "default filters". the new system should be
  able to handle loading arbitrary analysis files as default filters. Matching
  is done via the module type names.

* non-existent workspace directories mentioned in the mvme.ini file are
  silently created. This is annoying when renaming a workspace and starting mvme again.
  Instead the dialog to select a workspace directory should pop up.

* analysis: inline rename of 2d histos does not work because of text updates to
  the node. These updates should probably be suppressed while inline editing is
  active.

* analysis: disabling of operators would be cool

* Filter: mdpp16 samples: kanalwort, dann werte
  -> so eine art subheader
  -> subheader suchen, addresse extrahieren und merken
     danach weitere daten mit weniger adressbits oder positionsbasierter offset zur "base address" und
     natuerlich datenbits extrahieren
     wenn wieder ein subheader kommt (via match erkannt) dann base address anpassen und damit weitermachen
* Mehr siehe Zettel!

* Things missing to support other vendors modules:
  - CAEN v1190: Need to check a register bit to know when the chip controlling the CERN
    TDCs is ready. This could be done in software or on the MVLC via a special command.

* multi_event_splitter: count unused words (per event and module) if possible.
  make this data available as a counter.

* add functionality for checking if the scripts in the vme tree can be parsed
  successfully. Right now parse errors are only detected on DAQ startup.

* write unit test for CrateConfig import/export

* log the DAQ run duration when the DAQ is stopped

* Analysis processing skip flag:
  Decide directly after the data filters if this events output should be
  further processed and passed to the EventServer or if it should be
  skipped/filtered out.

  The decision should be based on the current(?) values and previous data.

* MDPP-16_SCP "variable rate" setup:
  threshold 0
  gain >= 2000
  WindowOfInterest -100ns
  -> pulser data should appear to be uniformely or randomly distributed

* apparently there's a crash when compiling an expression operator script while
  a replay is running. Robert ran into this while editing an expression and
  lost all of his edits... Cannot reproduce

* event_server: test with the mvlc. measure performance
* mvme_root_client: runId is incorrect for live DAQ runs. it seems correct for replays.
* test m2r. get rid of duplicate files. clean up the env file. write some docs
* improve mesytec diagnostics

* qthelp: most images are links but they do show the binary file contents
  instead of the image. Note that not all images behave this way. Some are not
  clickable, e.g the very first 'mvme overview' image in the introduction.

* heisencrash when deleting vme scripts? might have been due to changing
  compile flags. not sure.

* MVLC release work
--------------------------------------------------
  - use mvlc trigger io docs for the standalone mvlc doc
  - lib design: (+ are things we want and that are mostly clear, ? are unclear things)
    + direct mvlc com, direct vme com, stack upload, stack exec, irq setup,
    + readout_worker, queued communication, lossless or lossfull queueing strategies
    + blocking consumer channel (listfile) and non-blocking consumer channel (queue)
    + stack -> readout parsing, readout reassembly
    + stats, logging, python wrapper
    ? trigger_io setup, automatic periodic stack setup

  - multicreate: merging of the data stream. different strategies, one true way?

analysis_ui: no small toolbar stats display with mvlc (rate, replayRate, etc)

* do add in per pipe and per packet channel stats displays for the mvlc!
* mvlc parser debugging

* change the analysis default filters generation to allow including custom
  calibration operators and other things in the default_filters.analysis for
  each module. The use case is to calibrate the module_timestamp to
  microseconds by default and to allow custom calibrations for some of the
  mdpp32_qdc time data.
  Think about how this should be implemented. Some partial analysis or analyis
  object library or something.
  -> object rewrite code is already in place. When creating default filters the
  source module is known, thus the object graph can be rewritten to connect to
  that module. A problem is still the naming of things. Since the introduction
  of directories for the default calibrations and histograms the indvidual
  operator names can be pretty generic but the directory names should contain
  the module name they're connected to. Use placeholders in the template names?
  %m to be replaced by the actual module name?

* think about moving the business logic in vme_config_ui into factory functions
  for new EventConfig and ModuleConfig instances. Also factor out things like
  getting the next available mcst address.
  -> done for EventConfig (vme_config_util.h)

* trigger_io gui [maybe]
  - show static connections when hovering over units.
  - highlight possible connections when hovering a pin
  - allow making connections by dragging from pin to pin or by clicking two
    pins.
  - maybe allow inline editing of names.
  - ellide long names. maybe add logic to make the block wider when longer
    names are used or increase the width in general.

http://www.sympnp.org/proceedings/57/G29.pdf

* load and save button in the trigger ui editor are hidden now.
  implement the functionality!
  what should happen if the script is not a trigger io script? meaning the
  correct meta block doesn't exist in it?
  -> display error message, leave existing script untouched
* generate text file of input and output names used in the setup. this could be
  printed and used at experiment time to figure out what's what.

* when modifying the mvlc trigger io via the gui the vme config is not marked
  as modified. I'm not sure why because the underlying script does get
  modified. Maybe i'm ignoring the modification on purpose?

* daqcontrol listfile filename is not updated when using the vmusb
* Event Server component only mentioned in the daq_control section of the docs.
  This needs to have its own section once it performs better.

* Docs: info about basic controls. right-click context menus, shift and control
  click selections, double clicks :D

* Help overlay for the analysis. Big fat arrows indicating data flow and arrows
  pointing at histograms.

* LUT editor minimize might not be correct. Test this more. Mostly I confuse
  myself when creating functions.

* add readout side buffer sniffing similar to what's done on the analysis side.
* after finishing a run/replay with pause enabled the next run will always
  start paused even after having toggled pause/resume
* analysis pause does not work when replaying from mvlc(_usb) listfile

* when creating a new counter difference rate monitor the x-axis label says
  'not set'. also the y-axis label has no effect. toggling the top-right
  'combined' checkbox fixes this.

MVLC mac address for 0007: 04:85:46:d2:00:07

Mon 09 Dec 2019 04:21:00 PM CET Performance Tests with the MVLC
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Linux, USB3, MTDC, Pulser 7 (event len 26-30), 100 max_xfer     -> 127 MB/s
TODO: vary max_xfer for the above test
* Linux, USB2                                                   -> 38 MB/s (USB2 limit)
* Linux, ETH, MTDC, Pulser 7 (event len 26-30), 10 max_xfer     -> TODO


* make all name input dialogs only accept valid C identifiers

* MVLC issues
======================
* the controller stays 'connected' even tought the command or data pipe
  operations lead to connection error. for example when turning off the
  mvlc_usb the error poller will get FT_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED but the
  MVLC_VMEController will not be set to disconnected.

* After a boot the firmware and hardware registers yield 0. Only after starting
  and stopping a DAQ those registers are populated. Try to narrow this down.
  -> Test this again with the latest MVLC firmware

* Trigger I/O Editor:
  - Add ability to reserve units. Used for Timer and StackStart units when
    periodic events are present.
  - Add ability to generate a script containing only selected/modified units

* NSIS installer: make sure there's no "release" component when packaging the
  release branch. This is just because I noticed a 'dev' component in the dev
  builds.

* NSIS Installer: make the zadig installer less prominent and annoying.
  -> Add a page asking if you're using the VMUSB. If true go to zadig page,
  else skip it.

* failing host lookups block the gui. espcially noticeable when loading a
  replay and starting it. the gui will feel unresponsive.
* 'QuaZipFile::close(): file isn't open' warnings when recording with the MVLC_ETH


 Configurable Button Grid for VME Scripts
------------------------------------------

Buttons in a grid. Can do single column and single row layouts.
Other layout options? No. Just allow having less buttons than (rows * cols).
Also do not immediately discard data when resizing the grid. Instead use it in
case the number of buttons increases again.

Edit mode:
  Set Number of rows
  Set Number of columns
  assign objects or actions to buttons
  Set checked/unchecked action/object
  Set checked/unchecked icon
  set button label
  Override icon

Feature: Checkable buttons where one script is executed on check and one on un-check.
         Have different labels for the states.
         -> Implement this externally from the grid. By passing the bool 'checked' around.
         Note: passing the checkstate to the outside means that QSignalMapper
         cannot be directly used.  Instead two mappings, one for the checked
         and one for the unchecked case can be used.

Feature: Repeat mode
         Set repeat interval.
         Add extra checkboxes next to each button. If checked the action will
         be executed periodically.
         Checkable buttons will toggle between states as if clicked manually.
         Note: there's no way to have different intervals for the checked and
         unchecked states.

* Analysis:
  - Connecting to arrays of size 1 is not great: the index[0] is always used
    when generating names for objects
  - Play around with connecting to things. Some cases are worse than they where
    in previous mvme versions.
    -> Difference: first input connects to an array of size 1. Now the 2nd
       input only accepts values instead of full arrays even if those have size 1.
  - Check that histo under/overflow is working with active subranges.
  - Figure out how the entrycount for histos works right now. It does not get
    reset when the histo is reset, only when a new run starts.

* mvme_root_client: on new run detect if the incoming data is compatible in
  case things are already loaded. use streaminfo, maybe generate code in memory
  and compare to on disk versions
* fix the EventServer "disconnect on listfile" load issue
  -> Managing Qt thread affinity and parent/child things are the real problems
  here. Maybe a non-qt rewrite of the server component would be a good idea?
* how to get run completion info when interrupting a replay in mvme?
  buffers_processed can be equal to buffers_read. The issue is that not all of
  the listfile was read. Maybe use a SystemEvent::End
* void MVMEContext::prepareStart() starting mvme stream worker
  Qt has caught an exception thrown from an event handler. Throwing
  exceptions from an event handler is not supported in Qt.
  You must not let any exception whatsoever propagate through Qt code.
  If that is not possible, in Qt 5 you must at least reimplement
  QCoreApplication::notify() and catch all exceptions there.

  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'vme_script::ParseError'

* when writing a zip listfile change the names of the analysis and message log
  files to contain the run id. this also needs changes to the loading code when
  searching both of these files.
* cleanup threaded listfile writing code. Also come up with a way to handle write
  errors.

* analysis refactoring:
  - Get rid of most of data_filter.h in ~/src. Implement what's needed in terms
    of the a2 data filter. I think what's needed is something to contain the
    original strings and forward everything to the a2 implementation of the
    filter.

  - Get rid of Parameter::value but add a name field instead.  The high level
    parameter vector pipes are not needed to hold data and valid/invalid state
    anymore. Instead a feature for naming individual array elements should be
    added. The name could be stored directly in the parameter.

  - Get rid of runtime data from the higher level Analysis layer.  Refactor
    Analysis to only contain config data and output size calculations where
    needed. Maybe move runtime information and the a2 adapter into a separate
    state object. This way Analysis would not be responsible for config
    storage, connection logic, building and running.

  - Rethink the connection logic, who owns things and when they are destroyed.
    Also redesign how threading and the worker startup logic is done. Try to
    use a copy of the analysis inside the worker. Make ui access to the runtime
    data safe.

* Protect access to the globals DAQStats object with a mutex.

* histogram data is wrong after zooming and applying a subrange

* check out 'pigz' by Mark Adler for how to compress data in parallel.
* Maybe: slow mode for replay so that users can see what's going on.
* Nicer format for analysis rates (top side): less decimals, monospace font
* When clearing histos the entry counts in the analysis tree do not reflect the
  new counts (bottom row of analysis ui).

* revive the event_server client code. treewriter_client2 needs some work.
  Then document the whole thing and the idea behind it.


* fix the windows warning about winsock2.h before windows.h include order warning somehow
* MVLC_ReadoutWorker: If no data was read within some interval that fact should be logged.

* readout code and timetick sections in the listfile:
  if multiple timeticks are generated by
  TimetickGenerator::generateElapsedSeconds() in one of the readout workers
  and then written to the listfile using via
  m_listfileHelper->writeTimetickSection() then the text contents of the
  timetick sections in the listfile will all contain the formatted datetime
  value of the point in time where writeTimetickSection() is called. This means
  multiple timeticks will have the same formatted time string instead of each
  being different by rougly 1s.
  When does timetick gen generate more than one second?
  -> If the readout loop blocks for >= 2s. Otherwise if the time difference is
  >= 1s only one tick will be generated and the remainder is stored for the
  next tick.
  This is not a problem anymore with the MVLC because 64-bit unix timestamp
  values are stored in the contents of the timetick system event.

* use TicketMutex in histograms

* Design and implement an interface to make VMEScript extendable. This way
  controller specific functions do not need to be implemented directly in the
  VMEScript implementation but could be added dynamically when switching VME
  controllers.
  Also and probably more important is that libmvme_core would not have to
  depend on VMUSB anymore.

* Find a better way to access global actions than the method used in
  VMEConfigTreeWidget::setupActions(). Maybe use a global action factory thingy
  returning QAction "singletons".

* remote control: issuing a start followed by a stop can crash the application.
  There are missing checks if the system is transitioning. Set a flag
  immediately before calling startDAQ and unset it either on error or when the
  start succeeded. While the flag is set do not allow calls to startDAQ/stopDAQ
  but return "Starting"/"Stopping", etc
* JSON RPC Remote Control and/or DAQ Start/Stop handling is still buggy!
  Quickly issuing startDAQ/stopDAQ commands (including multiple starts/stops in
  sequence) can end up in a broken state and eventually lead to a crash:
    DAQ: Idle, Analysis State: Running is shown in the gui
    Crash in the json rpc code but I believe the heap is corrupted before that.

    In MVMEContext::startDAQReadout(): introduce a definitive DAQ/System state
    inside MVMEContext that is modified from within the GUI thread only and
    that reflects what the state the system is in.
    Set this flag to "Starting" right before issuing invokeMethod calls on the
    workers. This way multiple calls to startDAQ in quick succession would not
    cause an issue as the 2nd call would immediately see the "Starting" state.

    Also in stopDAQ check that the current state is "Running" only then issue
    the stop request to the worker threads.

* when trying to open a workspace but the directory does not actually contain a
  workspace (ini missing is the only hard criteria I think) then ask the user
  if she wants to create a workspace instead of just creating stuff.

* during a replay extract timestamps from timetick text and pass this on to
  data consumers.
  think about storing a 64bit seconds-since-epoch value instead to avoid having
  to parse string data.
  On the other hand I do like the string data.
  In any case timezone information is not stored right now but I think
  durations are more interesting to the user than absolute points in time.

data transfer client lib
- no libmvme dependency
- depends on headers shipped with mvme at compile time
- header only for now

root data transfer client
- uses data transfer client lib

high level overview:
- connect to server
- receive run description
- generate code for exported objects, Experiment, Events, Modules, data members inside the modules.
- at this point the base class interfaces are known to the compiler, but not the
  concrete, newly generated specific classes
- the generated code is built and loaded using TSystem::Load()

- the specific Experiment subclass can be instantiated via
  auto exp = reinterpret_cast<TheExperimentClassName *>(
     ProcessLineSync("new TheExperimentClassName()"));
-> We now have a working Experiment instance that can generate its event trees
  and that can be queried for events and modules.
- open output file now and generate the event trees using the virtual exp->MakeTrees()

During the run switch on the incoming event number and fill the corresponding
event and module data structures. Figure out how to safely fill the arrays
without crashing in case of size mismatches, etc.
Then call fill on the event tree to commit the data to ROOT.

1) At this point more code could be loaded, e.g. from a user lib.
What's needed: begin and end hooks and hooks for specific events.
Also info on whether this is a replay or an online run.

NOTE: Now there are multiple ways to replay data: from within mvme doing the
steps outlined above and from an existing output ROOT tree.


/* State of the analysis UI and future plans
 *
 * Finding nodes for objects
 * Can use QTreeWidgetItem::treeWidget() to get the containing tree.  Right now
 * trees are recreated when updating (repopulate) and even with smarter updates
 * trees and nodes will get added and removed so the mapping has to be updated
 * constantly.
 * Can easily visit nodes given a container of analysis objects and create
 * chains of node handling objects. These objects could be configured by giving
 * them different sets of trees and modes. Also the responsibility chains could
 * be modified on the fly.

--------------------------------------------------
BUGS
--------------------------------------------------
* runid handling: currently a chicken egg problem:
  the readout worker thread generates a new run filename and tries to open that file.
  errors can happen and thus the run cannot proceed properly. also the runid
  information  cannot be sent to e.g. clients connected to the data server.

  Fix: move output file creation, opening and error handling from the readout worker
  to the main thread and pass the open file handle to the readout worker.

* When having a single h1d bin filled the calculated and displayed fwhm of the
  gauss is 1, but I was told it should be 0. Figure this out and fix it.
* Recheck/Test ConditionFilter

* Analysis single step button can hit an assertion when clicked in quick
  succession

* blt count reads do not work properly. This needs fixing for both controllers.
  Being able to run those commands by uploading a command list and executing
  that directly would be very helpful for debugging this.

  - VMUSB: data is offset by 16 bits and this looks mangled. The parser code errors out.

  - SIS: figure out what's happening. It looks like the number read from the
    register is put into the data stream (verify).

* analyis processing trees: After renaming an object resort the tree it is contained in.
  This will conflict with the planned manual sorting of DataSources. Do not auto sort
  the data extraction tree.

* Add a refresh button to the ui. (same a repop right now, just with a nicer icon :)

* SIS: when not connected and doing an Init Module mvme hangs in recvfrom()

* Editing a H2D name via 'F2' is not really possible while a run is active. The
  nodes text will be updated periodically which interferes with editing.

* When changing VME event trigger conditions the readout cycle end script can
  become empty. How? What's happening? Is this true?

* Add BlockReadFlags to VMEController::blockRead() and implement support for
  the controller side wordswap in the sis library.

--------------------------------------------------
Testing setup for ESS
--------------------------------------------------
* Use RPC interface to start/stop the DAQ
* Enable Jumbo Frames!
* Do this repeatedly with different amounts of on/off time.
* Check the results of the RPC calls.
* Poll stats peridocally and make sure they are valid.
* Try with listfile writing on and off.
* Cycle 100 times or more

According to Anton things get unstable with Jumbos enabled (he cannot enable
the pulser which looks like register writes are failing). Also mvme crashes
sometimes when starting a new DAQ run.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WISHLIST
--------------------------------------------------
* unify runinfo into a single variantmap
* Think about file I/O for the expression operator
* Add new data sources yielding:
  - the current timetick value (1s granularity, paramvector of size 1)
  - the current event #

* Doc: add ListFilterExtractor to Data Sources
* DAQ Start and then immediately pressing "Run script" in the debug window
  causes a crash.
* Debug CBUS functionality: MDPP-16 doesn't get a CBUS result after leaving DAQ
  mode. It's needs a write to the reset register to make it work again. Why?

* if loading a config file fails when opening a filename from the
  mvmeworkspace.ini file show an explicit error message about the filename in
  the ini possibly being wrong.

* void Histo1DWidgetPrivate::calibApply()
  void Histo1DWidgetPrivate::calibResetToFilter()
  Change them to make use of the improved analysis rebuild mechanism

* JSON RPC: add info about SIS hostname/IP and firmware revision and VMUSB usb
  port and firmware.

* Try to get rid of the module assignment dialog. Instead use the "unassigned"
  category for data sources, the usual "input is not conneceted -> draw in red"
  way of communicating issues with the operator to the user and drag/drop to
  fix module assignments.

  Problems: events may not match up at all. Right now there's no way to display
  stuff that can't be assigned to a particular VME event. Also cross-event
  drag/drop is not possible in any way right now.

* workspace and vme controller settings and such:
  Roberts use case is: open listfile, try to locally reproduce problems a
  customer has. This means he will in most/all cases have to change the sis
  address or even the controller type to match his local setup. This is
  annoying. Even more of a problem is that after making changes he has to
  change the SIS back to the customer settings if he wants to send them the
  listfile.

  Instead when loading a listfile keep the local controller settings and/or use
  a "dummy" controller.

  My use case: see exactly what the customer is doing: hostname or ip-address,
  jumbo frames, additional controller settings. I sometimes really need this
  info and do not want it to be hidden behind some magic.


* New Feature: add pause/resume markers and/or absolute timestamps to the listfile.
  This would allow for example splitting the run on pause/resume if the user
  changed settings in-between.

* RPC: limit max request size to something reasonable
* RPC: fork jcon-cpp on github and push local changes there

* Improve the loadAnalysisConfig() and similar callchains. Right now they end
  up in gui_read_json_file() which displays a message box with a generic "could
  not read from" error but nothing specific.
  Return value can be tested by checking for isNull() on the returned document.

* Multievent: figure out how and if the stream processor correctly handles
  modules that are disabled in the vme config.
* FIXME: why does mutli event for the whole event get disabled if one of
  the modules is disabled? This does seem unnecessary.

* in openWorkspace(): figure out if the special handling of the listfile output
  dir is really needed.

* try to apply DRY to analysis and vme config serialization. grep for
  "DAQConfig" and "AnalysisNG" extract that code into functions and update
  callers

* multi output arraymap
* constant generator operator:
  multiple outputs
  stepped each time the event has data (a2_end_event)
  fixed rank of 0 so that these are always stepped first, thus consumers can
  count on having the data be active on the output pipes

* DAQ readout performance: try to make better use of the data buffers.
  Currently one processed controller buffer ends up in the data buffer, which
  means for sis it's only around 1500 bytes.
  Do the following: put events into the same buffer until less than a user-set
  limit is free in the buffer or a specific time interval has passed. Then
  write the buffer to disk and in case of a non-local buffer put it into the
  "full" queue.
  Make sure the condition where an event should still go into a certain buffer
  but the space inside the buffer is not enough is reported properly. In this
  case the user-set limit has to be adjusted.
  Reallocations of the buffer could be done but the case where a buffer is
  enlarged again and again must be avoided.

* a2::Operator_KeepPrevious does not seem to set output limits. Is this bugged?
  Fix the test case if needed.

--------------------------------------------------
ExpressionOperator future design plan
--------------------------------------------------
Additional/Advanced Features:
* user defined functions using the exprtk syntax. SECTION 15 -> function_compositor
  Limited to returning a single scalar value and up to six input parameters
  - function name
  - args and their names
  - code

   // define function koo1(x,y,z) { ... }
   compositor
      .add(function_t()
         .name("koo1")
         .var("x").var("y").var("z")
         .expression("1 + cos(x * y) / z;"));

  -> one function compositor per operator. This also allows to define recursive
  functions and functions that call other "dynamic" functions.

  Also check out the add_auxiliary_symtab() method of the compositor. This
  would allow having access to variables from arbitrary symbol tables in the
  function body definition. -> use the a2 runtime library symbol table with this method.

* persistent / static variables

  Could be used to keep some accumulator or the last N events or the last
  result around in the step script.

  statics would be (re)initialized at compile time and then kept during calls to step.

  To make this work the following is needed:
  for scalars: name and initial value
  for arrays: name and size.

  Then the expression operator can create the variables in the symbol table
  instance and initialize them.
  These variables will only be available in the step expression.
  The size definition of arrays must be done via an expression aswell as that's
  the only way to dynamically get to the input sizes. This script will have the
  same symbol table as the begin expression.

  Alternatively could use a return statement returning pairs of (name,
  variable) and then loop through the variables and create and register the
  appropriate types.

  Which solution is better?


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* 13:22:12: SIS3153 Warning: (buffer #109373) (partialEvent) Unexpected packetStatus: 0x89, expected 0x132. Skipping buffer. (suppressed 105 earlier messages)
  packetStatus 0x132 is not valid! This should wrap.
* SIS readout: received count and Timestamp histo count have a small delta of 1
  up to 3 counts. Figure out where this is coming from.

* listfile writing, MVMEStreamWriterHelper: can writing of the final EndMarker
  be moved into closeEventSection? I was surprised that this had to be done
  manually.

* efficiency: when the efficiency is slightly below 100% the display will still
  show a 1.00 due to rounding. maybe color the number if it's not 100%.

* New Export/ListfileFilter Idea: use an operator to decide whether a full, raw
  VME data event should be copied to an output listfile or be suppressed.
  This is basically a copy and filter operation for listfile with the decision
  being made at an arbitrary point in the analysis for the specific event.
  This needs access to the raw input data.

* Transport more state of the DAQ to the analysis side. Right now the stream
  processor always creates a session auto-save even if the DAQ did not start up
  successfully (e.g. because the controller already was in DAQ mode).  Need to
  set some flags in the stream worker so that it can decide on which actions to
  perform and which to skip.

* zachary use case: splitting data by time: 1st, 2nd and 3rd hour. good system
  to solve these kinds of problems.

* add example of how to extract an extended timestamp (48 bits) from our modules to the documentation

* Tell Tino about SIS packet loss detection not being accurately possible
  because of the sequence numbers only appearing before events, which has the
  effect that with partial and/or multievent packets, the number of packets and
  the sequence number do not match 1:1 anymore.

  In the original SIS3153 format this wasn't an issue as there was no buffering
  or partials.

  A real packet number prefix would be ideal.

* Maybe add a session file browser/explorer thingy. Could even allow multiple
  open sessions at once. Make sure histos and other objects clearly show which
  session they belong to.

* Change analysis input selection handling to not modify the involved operators
  directly. Instead create fake input pipes and connect the target operator to
  those. Event better would be to create a clone of the original operator to be
  edited and work on that with fake inputs.
  This way no pausing and/or clearing would have to be done if the user opens
  the editor, clicks around and then cancels.
  Also if only the name or unit info is edited nothing actually would need to
  be rebuild (NOTE: some operators might pull copies of their input unit labels
  or prepare some calculation depending on the limits so be careful with
  this!).


* Fix assertion when building a2 (might lead to corruption or crashes in a
  release build!) in the following scenario:
  - H1DSink is connected to a DataFilter by a direct index connection.
  - The address bit of the filter are edited by the user. The new number of
    address bits is less than the old number.
  - The H1DSink is now connected to an index that doesn't exist anymore.
  - The a2 adapter will assert because no histo is found for the index.
  This also affects other operators. Fix this!

* Rate Monitor Widget:
  - make sure rate values are scaled to the "middle" of the y axis
  - improve time labels: don't show hours and minutes if time scale is less than a minute
  -> This has the problem that if you look at a window of the last 60
  seconds, in a run that's over an hour long you won't see the hour number. You
  lose the information that you're in hour 1 plus x in the run.
    I could check if the scale is past a threshold and then switch the formatting.

    if (elapsed_time > 1 hour)
        set scale for intervals below the hour threshold to show hours
    else
        use a scale that hides the hours

    Does the same problem happen for other intervals?

* All filters: make sure address bits are <= 16. This is a reasonable limit and
  avoids crashes due to wrong inputs into the filter fields.

* VME Script "Run" button: this still blocks the GUI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Export Implementation - ExportSink
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More ideas from Robert:
* Make it possible to export multiple events into the same file. This will need
  a way to select data from different events. Also the file needs to contain
  the event number for each record.
* Add a "system" event containing the current timetick count and systems stats,
  rates, etc.

* The export sink needs to log which output file is being written! Right now
  it's all very mysterious.
* (maybe) byte order marking. The bin file are not meant as permanent storage
  but to be consumed by a user program which then stored data in e.g. ROOT
  format.
* (maybe) file magic number
* (maybe) version number

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* add build date to info window thingy
* Andi has a setup where the "compression" combo box has an empty value. no/fast compression can still be selected but the initial value is empty.
* filters: add option to disable adding the random value (done for listfilters)


* Projection of combined H2D does not update axis scales after the source H1D
  has been recalibrated.
* Changing H1D calibration via its widget clears all histograms. This is not
  needed as only the interpretation of the data in the histo changes. Improve
  this case so that it keeps existing histo data.
  -> This needs fixing in Histo1DSink::beginRun(): currently the histo
  mem is cleared no matter what changed.
  Also the case where the analysis is not running has to be taken care of: the
  AnalysisPauser won't invoke reusmeAnalysis() and thus it won't be rebuilt.

* add sis3153 firmware update utility to 'extras' directory. Also package and
  install sis library code (maybe). Ask struck if this is allowed.

* Add element wise array multiplication operator and/or a calibration operator
  using slope and offset values.

* add 64 bit DataFilter
* phase out data_filter.h (DataFilter and MultiWordDataFilter). stick to the a2 stuff
* Make mvme internal "system" rates available to the analysis.
  Might split this into VME and Analysis rates. Think about how to feed those
  to the analysis system.
  Make this efficient and easily integrated.

* RateHistory needs to only be kept if the specific rate should be plotted.
  Otherwise if the rate should only be displayed it's enough to keep the last
  (most recent) rate value that was calculated. The GUI should be able to pick
  that up.

  Totals are also interesting and should be displayed alongside rates.

System design:
List / Tree of available counters. Must be able to deal with arrays of known
size, like ModuleCounters[E][M]. On the other hand at runtime it is known how
many events and modules there are so only parts of the arrays have to be
exposed.

Hierarchy is good. Names are good. Serialization of the information to restore
a counter display and the required history buffers is needed.
Then be able to find a RateHistoryBuffer via a "hierarchy path".


readout.bytes
readout.buffers
streamProc.bytes
streamProc.event[0] .. event[N] with N either begin MaxVMEEvents or the actual number of events in the VMEConfig
streamProc.event[0].module[0] with limits being the number of events and the number of modules in that event

accessor function to get the current counter value
accessor function to get the previous counter value
-> delta calc possible
accessor to get calibration variables and unit labels and additional options
accessor to get the RateHistoryBuffer for the specific counter
-> filling the buffer is possible

With a system like this different counters could be updated in different
places, e.g. some counters could be handled entirely in the GUI, others might
be updated iff it's a replay and a timetick section is processed.

The update code needs an efficient way to query the rate monitoring system for
counters it needs to process:

void foo(double sample_value)
{
    // constant during the course of the run
    auto byteRateHandle = get_handle_for("daqtime.streamProc.bytes");

    enter_sample(byteRateHandle, sample_value);
}

// FIXME: where does dt come from? does each "sampler" have to pass its own dt?
void enter_sample(RateHandle handle, double value, double dt_s)
{
    prev = value(handle);
    delta = calc_delta0(value, prev);
    setValue(handle, value);
    setDelta(handle, delta);
    rate = delta / dt;
    rate = calibrate_rate(handle, rate)
    if (auto historyBuffer = get_rate_history_buffer(handle))
    {
        historyBuffer->push_back(rate);
    }
}

void handle_replay_timetick() // somewhere in the MVMEStreamProcessor
{

    for (int ei = 0; ei < MaxVMEEvents; ei++)
    {
        for (int mi = 0; mi < MaxVMEModules; mi++)
        {
            enter_sample()
        }
    }

    if (rate_monitor_enabled_for(handle))
        rate_monitor_sample(
}

Rate Monitoring in the analysis
-------------------------------
Experiment time rates are what's interesting, not the rates achieved during a
replay! This means sampling should happen based on replay timeticks or for periodic events
every time the event is triggered.


* Data sources and types
  - Values from periodically reading out the counter value of a scaler module.  Rate
    calculation and then sampling has to be done using two successive scaler values. The
    result can then be recorded in a RateHistoryBuffer.

    -> Right now something roughly similar can be achieved using Calib, KeepPrevious and
       A-B to calculate a rate.

    -> This functionality could be combined in a RateCalculation operator which could then
       be used as the input for a RateHistorySink.
       This approach would also allow to use the calculated and calibrated rate as the
       input for further operators.

    * How this case plays out:
      VME readout is triggered, data is read and transfered to the analysis.  The
      corresponding analysis event is stepped. DataSources consume the readout data and
      yield output values (processModuleData). Operators are stepped in the EndEvent step,
      where they can consume the data source output values.

      Storing the calculated rate could happen every time the event is trigged. This would
      mean it's synchronous to the analysis stepping process. Also the rate recording
      interval would be the same as the interval at which the event is triggered.
      -> Doing synchronous sampling of the readout values only really makes sense for
      periodic events as otherwise the recording interval could differ immensely.

  - Readout of a module that yields a precalculated rate. No calculation is required, only
    recording of the rate values.
    Calibration might still be desired.

    -> Calibration plus RateSink would meet the requirements. Additionally the remarks for
    the first case above apply: recording can be done synchronously to processing the
    event in the analysis.

  - Extraction filter rates
    This type of rate does not use data values from the readout itself but is sort of a
    meta rate. Calculation can be done using the HitCounts array that's currently part of
    every data source in the analysis.

    -> The calculated rates can serve as input for a RateSink.
    To get a consistent timebase sampling and recording should be based on analysis
    timeticks. I think this means that a better resolution than the timetick one can not
    really be achieved.

FIXME: The case where the fraction of two rates should be monitored as in
Wanpengs tool has not been taken care of.

Input could be a pair of rate samplers. The fraction of the two samplers would
then be treated as a rate itself and accumulated in the history buffer in the
same way as a normal rate.
Be careful with the different rate types as they are updated at different times:
- System rates are currently updated in the gui
- Analysis rate values (Precalculated and CounterDifference) are updated each
  time the event is triggered.
- FlowRates are updated on each timetick which can be wallclock time for DAQ or
  experiment time for a replay.


--------------------------------------------------
Single Stepping and Stream Processing
--------------------------------------------------
* Show if multievent processing is active for an event
* Display buffer context in case of a parse error

* Distinction/difference between a stream and a buffer?
  As a buffer can contain multiple sections or even a complete listfile it is an MVMEStream.
  But an MVMEStream will mostly consist of multiple buffers as generated by the
  readout or from reading a listfile.

* Info to parse an mvme stream and report errors:
  - is multievent enabled for eventIndex N?
  - module header filter strings for (eventIndex, moduleIndex)
  - listfile format version

* State:
  BufferIterator
  EventIterator

* Result information for each step:
  - error?
  - error offset
  - data offsets: event section header, module section header, module data begin, module data end
    [number of this event section], [number of the module sections in the event section]
  Available info from the above: section type, event index

* Approaches to handling a stream:
  - Iterator style
    Create an StreamBufferIterator supplying all required information to parse
    the buffer.
    Call next() on the buffer until the result is atEnd.

  - Callback based
    The user passes in a structure containing callbacks for each section type
    and for module data. Not all callbacks have to be implented as they can be
    set to null.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--------------------------------------------------
* Remove now unused run-time code from the Analysis classes. Make it clear that
  they're for serialization, internal connectiviy and a2 generation only.

* cmake: Fix the issue with FindROOT adding to the global cflags. Might be
  fixed by moving everything ROOT related into a subdirectory.

* Get rid of automoc and as it mocs stuff that doesn't need mocing.

* Fix sphinx doc build when using the cmake ninja generator.

* Setup controller outputs (NIM, etc) to be active when DAQ is active and maybe
  more. Do this for both controllers and document and/or log what's being setup.

* Crash in a2_adapter when BinSumDiff inputs don't have the same length

* sis3153 implementation
  * On connect read the stacklist control register to figure out if the sis is
    in autonomous mode. If it is and a controller option "Reset SIS3153 on
    connect" is not set then consider the connection attempt to have failed.
    Reasoning: currently when accidentially connecting to a sis that's in use,
    a reset command will be sent and thus the running DAQ will be stopped. This
    can be quite bad if it happens during a real experiment.

  * Running "Init Module" when disconnected blocks the UI
  * Make the mblt count read commands work with the default data_len_format
    setting. Use the leftshift value of the sis register for this.
    Document the behaviour, maybe change the command to not include the mask
    anymore, etc...
  * Think about the sis3153 counted block read commands. Maybe add a "dialect" to
    vmescript so that the fact that sis3153 does not have a mask operation is
    clear.
  * Fix socket error messages under windows. Use and test the WSA stuff.


* check the case where listfile creation throws an exception. right now this
  results in a communication error with the sis controller when trying to start
  another run after a failed one.

* Fix anaylsis object selection color under win7. It's horrible and the text is
  not readable anymore.

* Improve VMEScriptEditor search:
  Make it get focus under windows and unity
  Make it get focus when hitting ctrl+f again
  Bind "find next" to F3 or something.
  Maybe add "highlight" all.

* Analysis: fix names generated by "generate default filters"

* Analysis: getDisplayName() and getShortName() are not that great. For the
  AggregateOps operator I'd like to display "Aggregate Operations" in the "add
  operator" context menu instead of "sum". Where else is getDisplayName() used?
  -> The above works. What I need now is to change the suggested operator name
  of selecting a different aggregate op. Right now it always appends ".sum".

* Resolution change for 2D combined histograms?
  -> Would have to implement this in a different way: Instead of just looking
  up the data in the corresponding H1D instances I'd have to create a new H2D
  with the desired resolution and insert the source values into that histogram.

* Make a RCbus example including a delay between switchting NIM to cbus mode!

* Implement adding of module specific vme init scripts via the GUI.
  The user should be able to modify the order of init scripts by
  dragging/dropping, remove existing scripts and add new ones.
  Optionally copying of an init script to the same or a different module could
  be implemented.

* Maybe reload the analysis on opening a listfile.
  Without the reload the analysis window can become empty if the listfile
  contains different module uuids than the ones in the analysis. A reload could
  trigger a simple 1->1 import of the module and all would be good again.
  The reload could als trigger opening the import dialog if it requires user
  intervention.

* Logspam still makes the app hang! Fix this!!!

* Histo1D and Histo1DWidget
    * Bug: H1D does not work when unitMin > unitMax
    * Histo1DWidget: zoom out after setHistogram()
      But not when the usage is the one in x- and y-projections where the histo is
      replaced with a similar one.
    * Read up on binning error calculations. See how ROOT does it.

* Analysis and AnalysisUI
    * Open new histograms immediately. Do this when creating a sub-histogram.
      Maybe only if DAQ/Replay is running?
    * Copy/Paste
      - Having the ability to clone operators would allow making editing of
        operators much safer.
        Right now if the user picks another input or clears any input slots the
        analysis has to be paused and restarted and dependent operators
        immediately notice the change. This means even if the user cancels the
        dialog the analysis can have unexpected modifications.
        With cloning a copy of the operator would be created. Selecting and
        clearing inputs would only affect the cloned version of the operator
        (input pipes would not need to be fully connected so the input sources
        do not need to change at all during editing -> half connected state!)

- Add error reporting to VMEConfig and Analysis version conversion and read routines

- Refactor gui_write_json_file() to write_json_file() and use exceptions to report errors.
  Meaning: implement functionality using exceptions and not caring about if
  it's used from the gui or not. Then build and use gui wrappers which show
  messageboxes where needed.

- Add warnings to template loading if there are duplicate module types
- Fix diagnosis window hanging and eating system memory when EOE check is
  active and a lot of errors are occuring

* Check for off-by-one errors in the 2D projection code

* lastlog.log:
  Write every logged message to lastlog.log. Do this in the main thread. Flush
  to disk frequently.
  At startup move lastlog.log to lastlog.1.log.
  Keep 5 logfiles around. 4 -> 5, 3 -> 4, 2 -> 3, 1 -> 2, 0 -> 1



* select input UI: disable other tree highlights while it's active.
* ZIP file support:
  On close:
  - write some user description text file to the zip. "Run description", "Run notes", "DAQ notes"
 - save/saveas/load error reporting

* VMEConfig
    * Allow Adding of VME-Init scripts to modules via the gui!

* EventWidget and AnalysisWidget repopulate:
  - Restore open PipeDisplays:
    Store (ObjectId, OutputIndex) to get the output pipe and (pos, size) to restore the widget.
  - Restore splitter states when recreating event widgets.
  - Restore node expansion state
    Could store QUuids for expanded object nodes and after repop rebuild the
    VoidStar set of expanded nodes by getting the pointers via the ids.
* Analysis structure:
  SourceEntry does not really need the eventId as the moduleId implicitly
  specifies the eventId.
* H1D: Take the median of the visible left and right edges. Subtract that value
  from the calculated statistics values. This is supposed to remove the noise
  to the left and right of a peak.
* HistoViewer: Ability to save filled Histograms to disk and reload them later.
  This will allow using histogram tools (fits, etc.) on loaded histos. It also
  allows comparing histos from different runs etc.
* Calculated listfile size in stats display and size shown by windows explorer
  are not the same at all. Why?
* // FIXME: when using subranges the getBinUnchecked() calculation often yields negative bins. why?
  Verify this does in fact happen.
* DAQStats:
  - add pause/resume
  - figure out why buffers/s never has a fractional part
    -> part of the system. addBuffersRead() and addBytesRead() each call maybeUpdateIntervalCounters().
       If we're reading less than 1 buffer per second the resulting
       bytesPerSecond will be 0 for that interval.
    How to make this better?
- License info needs Apache License for PCG. Maybe others. Check what is needed here!
  Also use info from resources/README
- VMUSB: if there are connect/reconnect errors write them to the log view
  Do this when porting to libusb-1.0 as that should also provide better error messages.
- VMUSB: make the mutex non-recursive!

* GUI
  * add versioning to the GUI state saved via QSettings. If the version changes
    use the default layout instead of restoring a possibly incompatible state.
  * add a "reset gui state" button somewhere

* add ability to add notes to VME/analysis config (maybe other objects too)
* VMEScript: add print command

* Histos:
  * add histogram cuts
  * add histogram fitting

* Mesytec Werbung ^^ Hintergrundbilder, Wasserzeichen, etc. (CSS Theme?)
* threading and vme commands
  * run vme scripts in a separate thread when invoked from the gui

* save and restore the zoom and pan of histograms
