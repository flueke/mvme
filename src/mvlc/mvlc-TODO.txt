* USB/ETH low level read cleanup
* USB2 loses data under windows. The beginning of the very first buffer of a readout gets
  lost. This means the initial F3 is not seen and we lose track of the buffer structure.

* Make a std::error_category for getaddrinfo (enum, category, make_error_code).
  It's needed for good winsock error reporting.

* The usb::Impl::read() on Windows and the eth::Impl::read() calls on both systems can take
  longer than the user specified timeout as they are issuing multiple read/receive calls
  internally, each using the previously set timeout value. Document this behaviour and/or
  work around it by taking into account how much time has elapsed between each of the
  individual read/receive calls.

* Low Level MVLC Ethernet Debugging:

    ifconfig enp2s0 192.168.42.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    arp -i enp2s0 -s 192.168.42.2 ab:cd:12:34:56:78

  Start wireshark or tcpdump in a second terminal window
    sudo tcpdump -i enp2s0 -vvXX

  Use netcat to generate an UDP packet containing "Hello, World!" as the payload.
    echo "Hello, world!" | netcat -u 192.168.42.2 9000

  To delete the arp entry:
    arp -i enp2s0 -d 192.168.42.2

Firmware 105 MAC address is 74:d0:2b:21:23:45

USB readout
-----------
* Read multiples of 1024 bytes (the USB3 max bulk transfer packet size)
* USB2: wMaxPacketSize is 512 for the bulk endpoints
* USB3: wMaxPacketSize is 1024 for the bulkd endpoints

* To maximize USB2 throughput both the read request size and the read timeout matter.
  Buffers sizes starting from 500k to 1MB seem to be ok. At 45MB/s reading a 1MB/s buffer
  will take 22 ms, so the timeout should be longer than that.
  If the timeout is too short readout rate will drop dramatically from 45MB/s down to 32
  MB/s with short timeouts. This was observed under Windows 10 using the FTDI driver that
  comes bundled with the OS.

  Very long timeouts will currently stall the GUI but this is just a matter of not doing
  I/O in the GUI thread. Instead things like QtConcurrent::run should be used to do the
  operation that requires a MVLC lock on a separate thread.

* A single call to FT_ReadPipeEx is limited to a size of 1MB under both operating systems
  and with both USB2 and 3.


ETH readout
-----------
Setting rmem_max can help a lot. SO_RCVBUF is limited by this kernel setting:
  net.core.rmem_max=104857600

If the RX dropped counter in `ifconfig` does not increase but there is packet loss at the
application level then having a large receive buffer can help. What this basically means
is that the software does not read fast enough from the socket so that the OS side buffer
fills up and packets are discarded at the OS level. Either make the application faster
(dedicated reader thread) and use larger application level buffers or increase the value
of rmem_max and set a large SO_RCVBUF size.

Using SO_RCVBUF short spikes can be handled by the OS. If the user-space application is
just plain too slow the large buffer will fill up eventually and application level loss
will occur again.
