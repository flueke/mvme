Marabou <-> mvme integration version 0
===============================================================================
Stuff present in Patricks raw129.root file:
  TMrbSubevent_Mesytec
  TUsrDeadTime
  TUsrSevtPpdataA
  TUsrHitBuffer
  TUsrHit
  TUsrSevtPpdataB
  TUsrSevtPpdataC
  TUsrSevtPpdataD
  TUsrSevtPptimeAB
  TUsrSevtPptimeCD
  TUsrSevtSca
  TUsrSevtPppos
  TUsrSevtRbsdata
  TUsrSevtChargedata

The above are things the ROOT auto loader complains about because it cannot
find implementations for them. Maybe other classes which can be loaded are
present but I do not know how to get that information.

The examples I have sadly do not match the objects above exactly due to
different names in the example Conf.C but translating names it should look like
this:

  TMrbSubevent_Mesytec: TObject
    Contains TUsrHitBuffer which stores TUsrHit objects which contain (channel,
    value) pairs and some additional information (magic timestamp (it's in
    100usec since starts!), ...).  Generated from Config.C and implemented in
    Analyze.{h,cxx}

  TUsrSevtDet1: TMrbSubevent_Mesytec
  TUsrSevtDet2: TMrbSubevent_Mesytec
    Implementation in Analyze.{h,cxx}. These contain fixed size int arrays for
    raw module data values.

  TUsrEvtDet1: TUsrEvent
  TUsrEvtDet2: TUsrEvent
    Implementation in Analyze.{h,cxx}. Base class TUsrEvent is implemented in
    Marabou: analyze/inc/TUsrEvent.h
    Has a TUsrSevtDet1 data member!




Marabou <-> mvme integration version -1 (the not so great way to do it)
===============================================================================

Project motivation and goals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current PPC/MBS based readout is rather slow and complex compared to using
modern FPGA based VME controllers. A main reason for this is that a realtime
operating system running on the PPCs has to handle all VME communications in
software.

Replacing the PPC with an FPGA based controller allows for much faster trigger
rates and higher data rates (factor 100 and more). Also the complexity of
having to generate, compile and run code for the PPC side is removed.

The main goal of this integration project is to use the mesytec 'mvme' software
with a modern VME controller for the readout side, while keeping as much of the
currently existing Marabou/ROOT based analysis code as possible.

To achieve the above goal a mvme -> Marabou analysis code generator program is
implemented. This program can be used to create the basic Marabou anaylsis code
template required to correctly interpret received readout data, map
channels/paramters to user defined names and call users custom analysis
functions. This step is basically a mapping of the mvme VME configuration to
the marabou configuration.

Also a system to start subprocesses and pass raw readout data in mvme listfile
format to those subprocesses will be added to mvme. One such adapter subprocess
can then consume mvme readout data and produce Marabou compatible ROOT files or
supply input to a running M_analyze process.

This design with small processes doing the code generation and data adaptation
work was chosen to keep the coupling between mvme and the current Marabou/ROOT
versions to a minimum. When upgrading Marabou/ROOT only these adapter processes
will have to be recompiled instead of having to rebuild the whole mvme package.

Changes from current marabou based readout
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The VME configuration now resides on the mvme side. The marabou part is
generated from the mvme configuration. The reason for this design is that the
correctness of the readout depends on the mvme vme configuration. Also mvme
supports more/different triggers depending on the VME controller in use. This
information is not present in the MBS based marabou config.

Instead of running M_analyze (or the C_analyze frontend) the user now has to
run mvme and start/stop the DAQ using the GUI or the builtin remote control
interface. mvme then in turn starts an M_analyze instance or an adapter
process.

Implementation parts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Implementation of subprocess handling inside mvme and correct and fast data
  passing between mvme and subprocesses.

* Standalone definitions and utility functions for mvme listfile stream format
  handling. This part should be used by adapter processes to make data handling
  easy and unified.

* Standalone parser code for the mvme vme configuration: the plan is to use a
  header-only c++11 json library to parse the config text into an easy to work
  with data structure.

* A mapping of mvme VME module types to marabou module classes. This could be a
  static table stored in the config adapter code.

* Implementation of the data adapter process which either produces a marabou
  compatible ROOT file or feeds directly into a running M_analyze process
  depending on what the best solution for the marabou side is.

Limitations and next steps
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* mvme right now supports only a single VME crate. Multi-crate support needs to
  be implemented as that's a feature present in MBS.
  A first step, adding the vme crate index to the listfile format has been
  done (the crate index is always set to 0 at the moment).

* Not all modules supported by mvme (which is pretty generic) will have a
  corresponding class implementation in Marabou. Can a generic class be used to
  represent something like e.g. a mesytec VMMR?

* With the current design the extraction of channels numbers and amplitudes or
  other data values from the raw readout data is done in two places: once in
  mvme using the user-configurable data filters and once in the marabou module
  code. Also if a user decides to start out with the mvme analysis (e.g. for
  first time debugging and online monitoring) that information cannot be
  exported.
  There exists an offline solution which allows to export mvme analysis data
  arrays to a binary file and generate c++/python code to read and work with
  these files. This could be changed to work online like the design above. Thus
  pre-extracted data could be transfered to the marabou side.
