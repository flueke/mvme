                                 Qwt License
                           Version 1.0, January 1, 2003

    The Qwt library and included programs are provided under the terms
    of the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (LGPL) with the following
    exceptions:
        1. Widgets that are subclassed from Qwt widgets do not
           constitute a derivative work.
        2. Static linking of applications and widgets to the
           Qwt library does not constitute a derivative work
           and does not require the author to provide source
           code for the application or widget, use the shared
           Qwt libraries, or link their applications or
           widgets against a user-supplied version of Qwt.
           If you link the application or widget to a modified
           version of Qwt, then the changes to Qwt must be
           provided under the terms of the LGPL in sections
           1, 2, and 4.
        3. You do not have to provide a copy of the Qwt license
           with programs that are linked to the Qwt library, nor
           do you have to identify the Qwt license in your
           program or documentation as required by section 6
           of the LGPL.
           However, programs must still identify their use of Qwt.
           The following example statement can be included in user
           documentation to satisfy this requirement:
               [program/widget] is based in part on the work of
               the Qwt project (http://qwt.sf.net).
