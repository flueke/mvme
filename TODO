==== Do these first! =====
* DAQ pause implementation
  * look at QFutureInterface (might be able to set QFuture results myself)

* When pulling the usb cable while daq is active the application hangs because
  error messages are logged constantly and without pause.

==== Do these later! =====
* add "Init Module" to VMEScriptEditor toolbar for module related scripts
    XXX: how should this work? take the possibly edited script from this editor
    and the other (init or interface settings) script from the config and run both?
    what if the other script is open in another editor window? it's not clear
    to the user what commands will actually be executed...

* fix Hist2D source definitions
* HistogramCollection improvements: subsections for amplitude, time, trigger time, etc
    => see data filter specification below
* TwoDimWidget: use QwtPlotHistogram instead of QwtPlotCurve
* add histogram filters
* add histogram fitting
* add log scale to 2d histograms (?)
* vmusb & mvme buffer debugging
* workspace concept
    - workspace directory
    - subdirectory for listfiles
    - subdirectory for vme-scripts
    - daqconfig.json
    - analysis.json
* make use of the "enabled" flag for vme scripts, modules, events, etc
* run vme scripts in a separate thread when invoked from the gui
* ReadoutWorker split into generic and controller specific parts:
    Generic part is responsible for:
        - running vme init scripts
        - creating and opening the output listfile

    Controller specific parts:
        - init
        - readout
        - shutdown
        - pause
        - resume

* module data filter specifications:
  P=pileup, O=overflow, U=underflow (add these as special histogram channels?)
  Histograms: array[A][D]++

  - MDPP (initialized to 16-bit output)
    * 16 amplitude values
      0001 XXXX PO00 AAAA DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD

    * 16 time values
      0001 XXXX XX01 AAAA DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD

    * 2 trigger time values
      0001 XXXX XX10 000A DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD

    - MADC (initialized to 13-bit output, independent of resolution)
    * 32 amplitude values
      00XX X1XX 000A AAAA 0O0D DDDD DDDD DDDD

  Histogram properties:
    - name
    - size in bits
    - value/ channel
    - unit (Text: "ps") // Histogram may show at 64k: "24 ps/chan" or at 8k res: "192 ps/chan"
    - zero point        (chan 2048 is zero, left negative, right positive)
