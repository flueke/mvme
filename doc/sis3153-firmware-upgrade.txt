SIS3153 firmware upgrade instructions
--------------------------------------------------

As you are going to read out multiple modules you could actually benefit
from upgrading the SIS firmware. In older versions the SIS produced a
special data word in the case where a module read out via (M)BLT did not
produce any data. It was not possible to distinguish between this special
data word or actual data coming from the module on the software side so this
behavior was changed.

For the upgrade you need a windows machine and a USB cable (doesn't have to
be USB3, slower connection types also work).

A ZIP archive containing the USB driver, the firmware loader and firmware image version
16.a6 (the latest as of March 2018).

I've uploaded a ZIP archive containing the USB driver, the firmware loader and
firmware 16.a6 to our website:
  https://mesytec.com/downloads/sis3153-driver_loader_firmware-16a6.zip

Once plugged in the SIS will show up in the Windows Device Manager under
"Other Devices". Right click and select "Update Driver Software" then "Browse"
and point it to 'sis3153-driver_loader_firmware/usbDriver'.

After installation the SIS should show up under "SIS Acquisition Devices".

Now start the loaderGUI.exe in 'sis3153-driver_loader_firmware/loaderGui'.
IMPORTANT: The loaderGUI has to be restarted after selecting the firmware image.

Select 'File -> Set FPGA Firmware Image' and select the
'sis3153-driver_loader_firmware/sis3153_v16A6.bin'.

Now restart the application and press the 'Update' button. The process will
take a while and I've even seen the "not responding" text appear in the title
bar of the window. Just leave it running till 100%. The SIS will reboot automatically
and when connecting via mvme again you should see a message like

"Opened VME controller SIS3153-0042 (address=sis3153-0042) - Firmware 0x16a6"

with the newly programmed version number at the end.
